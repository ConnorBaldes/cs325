This is the read me explaining how to execute program 3 written by Connor Baldes:

1. knapsack.cpp:
    -Compile: g++ -std=c++11 knapsack.cpp -o knapsack
    -Run: ./knapsack [number of items] [weight]

    *Note: When running executable two integers must be provided on the command line.
            The first must be the number of items, and the second must be the weight 

2. shopping.cpp:
    -Compile: g++ -std=c++11 shopping.cpp -o shopping
    -Run: ./shopping

    *Note: I included shopping.txt in my zip file, a file named "shopping.txt" must be
            in the working directory



PS: Problem two sucked.
